# 6Seeks (old version)

This tools aims to scan the internet-wide IPv6 network periphery. It is an asynchronous scanner which incrementally adjusts search directions, automatically prioritizing the survey of IPv6 address spaces with a higher concentration of IPv6 periphery devices. Its network periphery model is inspired by [Xmap]{https://github.com/idealeer/xmap}.

# Implentations

The implentations of (old) 6Seeks are introduced into [Scanning the Internet-wide Network Periphery: Towards IPv6 Vulnerability Discovery](old-6Seeks.pdf).

This paper has been rejected and We put it here in the hope that it helps.


# PR

We will continue develop 6Seeks, and a newly-improved 6Seeksa  will be available soon.
